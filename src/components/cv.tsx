      <SectionParagraph text="I designed and built the mobile architecture using React Native with Expo, implementing a Turbo Monorepo setup to enable efficient code sharing across multiple projects. I led the full development lifecycle of the Footshop mobile app, guiding it from initial prototyping through to production release and deployment on app stores. In parallel, I developed the Queens mobile app, Footshopâ€™s sister brand, leveraging the same shared architecture to accelerate delivery and maintain consistency. To ensure quality and reliability, I established end-to-end testing workflows using Maestro, achieving high test coverage across key user flows. Throughout the project, I worked closely with product managers, designers, and backend developers to deliver seamless, branded shopping experiences. A strong emphasis was placed on scalability, performance, and developer experience, supported by a clean and maintainable architecture." />
