/**
 * The business details, one pill along from the sound and zoom controls. No card
 * on the grid expands into /ico — it is registry data rather than work — so the
 * dock is where it can sit without pretending to be a card, and it stops the page
 * being reachable only from an invoice.
 *
 * Leaves with the zoom controls whenever a modal opens: corner chrome floating
 * over an open card is the one thing the dock should never be.
 *
 * A real anchor, so the route stays crawlable and middle-clickable; the click
 * handler only takes over to wrap the push in the same forward view transition
 * every other page is entered through.
 *
 * That the metal card survives the trip at all is down to `patches/metal-fx`:
 * stock, its shared WebGL renderer poisons its own replacement on teardown, and
 * every card after the first mount in a document comes up with no metal on it.
