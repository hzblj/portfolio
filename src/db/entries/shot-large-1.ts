    'Joined Footshop to lead the development of a new mobile app for iOS and Android. The work started as a small MVP focused on core e-commerce flows. Over time, it evolved into a strategic product used as a main mobile channel. The goal was to move fast, validate ideas early, and still keep the codebase ready for long-term growth. Expo and React Native were chosen to ship quickly on both platforms while keeping performance and developer velocity high.',
