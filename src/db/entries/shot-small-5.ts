    'We built a complete vehicle service flow for service technicians. A technician finds a car by license plate and opens a detailed view with full service history. During a repair, all work, parts, prices, and photos are added through a simple form. The service report is sent to the client mobile app. The client sees the total cost and confirms the service directly in the app.',
