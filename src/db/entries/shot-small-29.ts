    'I built the feedback builder where users create a feedback form from reusable question blocks. On the left side, questions can be added, reordered with drag and drop, duplicated, or removed. The right side shows a live preview that updates instantly as the form changes. There is also a preview mode to run the feedback flow as a real user would see it.',
